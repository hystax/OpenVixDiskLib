# VDDK NFC disk read

This document records how VMware VDDK reads VMDK sectors over NBD/NFC
after the open in `docs/nfc_open.md`, and how OpenVixDiskLib
(`NfcDisk.read` in `openvixdisklib/nfc_open.py`) reproduces
`VixDiskLib_Read`. Capture method:
`docs/reverse_engineering_procedure.md`.

## Mapping from VDDK

`VixDiskLib_Read(handle, startSector, numSectors, buf)` becomes one
`NFC_AIO_MSG_IO` (type 7) on the NFC socket. Units on the wire are
**bytes**, not sectors:

```
offset = startSector * sectorSize
length = numSectors * sectorSize
```

`sectorSize` is 512 from the `OPEN_FILE` reply on this lab disk.

| VDDK call                         | Wire effect                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 1, buf)`   | IO offset 0, length 512, one 512-byte fragment   |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 1, 1, buf)`   | IO offset 512, length 512                        |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 128, buf)` | IO length 65536 (AIO buffer size), one fragment  |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 129, buf)` | One request of 66048; **two** reply fragments    |

VDDK does **not** split a `Read` larger than the AIO buffer into
multiple requests. The client sends one AIO message; the server
answers with one or more same-`opId` replies, each carrying at most
the OPEN_SESSION buffer size (VDDK default 65536).
`vixDiskLib.nfcAio.Session.BufSizeIn64KB=32` advertises 2 MiB; a
129-sector read then returns **one** 66048-byte extra, and a 2 MiB +
512 read returns 2097152 + 512. See `docs/nfc_open.md` (OPEN_SESSION).

Sparse regions are still transferred as zeros. A read of 8 sectors at
LBA 8 on this disk was 4096 zero bytes on the wire, not a skip.

## Request (44 bytes)

Little-endian, after the usual 16-byte AIO header
(`magic 0xA100DA7A`, type 7, size 44, monotonic `opId`):

| Offset | Type     | VDDK `Read(start, n)`                                      |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | `uint64` | File handle from `OPEN_FILE`                               |
| 8      | `uint64` | Direction in low 32 bits; compression type in high 32 bits |
| 16     | `uint64` | Byte offset                                                |
| 24     | `uint64` | Byte length                                                |
| 32     | `uint32` | Byte length (same value)                                   |
| 36     | `uint32` | Byte length, or compressed extra size when compressed      |
| 40     | `uint32` | `0`                                                        |

An earlier guess that offset 36 was `NFC_DISK` (`2`) was wrong: a
1-sector VDDK read puts `512` in both `uint32` length fields. A Python
read that sent `(512, 2, 0)` still worked for one sector; OpenVixDiskLib
now matches VDDK.

`VIXDISKLIB_FLAG_OPEN_COMPRESSION_{ZLIB,FASTLZ,SKIPZ}` do not change
OPEN_FILE flags. The IO opcode at offset 8 is a `uint64`: low 32 bits
are still `0`/`1` (write/read), high 32 bits are the NFC compression
type actually used for *this fragment* — `0` none, `1` zlib, `2`
FastLZ, `3` SkipZ. At most one compression open flag may be set; the
server (or, for writes, OpenVixDiskLib itself) still falls back to
type `0` per fragment when compressing that fragment would not shrink
it. OPEN still uses handshake `PlainText`.

| Open flag / wire                    | Request extra                                  | Reply extra                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| No compression flag                 | Raw `length` bytes on write                    | Raw fragment at offset 32                            |
| ZLIB, data that shrinks             | Standard zlib stream; offset 36 = packed size  | Opcode type `1`; extra is a zlib stream of offset 32 |
| FASTLZ, data that shrinks           | FastLZ bytes; offset 36 = packed size          | Opcode type `2`; extra is FastLZ of offset 32        |
| SKIPZ, at least one all-zero byte   | Run-list format below; offset 36 = packed size | Opcode type `3`; extra is run-list of offset 32      |
| Any of the above, no size reduction | Raw bytes; opcode type `0`                     | Opcode type `0`; extra is raw                        |

Reads with a compression flag set always *request* that type. The
server may answer with that type or fall back to type `0`. Decompress
into the uncompressed fragment length at offset 32 and copy to the
dest at offset 28.

64 KiB chunks use FastLZ level 2 (first byte has bit 5 set). Smaller
chunks use level 1. VDDK’s URL form is `FASTLZ-vpxa-nfc://…`; authd
`PROXY` is unchanged.

### ZLIB (type `1`)

The extra is a standard zlib stream (`zlib.compress`/`zlib.decompress`
in Python; the 2-byte header starts `78 01` in this lab's captures) of
exactly the fragment's uncompressed bytes — no NFC-specific framing at
all beyond the usual opcode/offset-36-length fields shared with
FastLZ. This makes zlib the simplest of the three to implement.

### SkipZ (type `3`)

Captured from native VDDK writing/reading a fragment with real
zero-filled runs (an incompressible, all-non-zero fragment falls back
to type `0`, same as FastLZ/zlib). The extra is not general-purpose
compression — it only omits runs of zero bytes, keeping everything
else raw:

```
uint32 total_length     (== this fragment's uncompressed length)
uint32 reserved         (0 in every capture)
repeated, one per non-zero run, in ascending offset order:
    uint32 run_offset   (byte offset within this fragment)
    uint32 run_length
    <run_length bytes of raw data>
```

A fragment that is entirely zero encodes as just the 8-byte header
with no runs at all (verified against native VDDK: a write of all
zeros round-trips through a real ESXi session as an 8-byte SkipZ
extra). Run boundaries are **not required to be sector- or any other
kind of aligned** — verified by writing three non-zero runs at
arbitrary byte offsets (137, 900, 1990) with `openvixdisklib`'s own
byte-level scanner and reading the result back correctly with native
VDDK on the same fragment.

## Reply

Each fragment is: 16-byte AIO header (same `type` and `opId`) + 44-byte
payload + `chunkLength` data bytes.

Reply payload (handle is zeroed; lengths describe this fragment):

| Offset | Type     | Meaning                                                              |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | `uint64` | `0`                                                                  |
| 8      | `uint64` | `1` (read)                                                           |
| 16     | `uint64` | Byte offset of the **request** on disk                               |
| 24     | `uint32` | Total request length                                                 |
| 28     | `uint32` | Fragment byte offset **in this request** (`0`, `65536`, …), not disk |
| 32     | `uint32` | This fragment’s uncompressed byte length                             |
| 36     | `uint32` | Same as offset 32, or compressed extra size when compressed          |
| 40     | `uint32` | `0`                                                                  |

When there is a single fragment, offsets 24–31 look like a `uint64`
length (the fragment offset is 0). The 129-sector capture shows why
they are two `uint32`s: fragment 0 has `(66048, 0)` then chunk 65536;
fragment 1 has `(66048, 65536)` then chunk 512. `0x00010000` at offset
28 is the byte offset, not a 0-based index. Disk byte address of a
fragment is request offset (payload 16) plus payload 28.

Read loop: receive fragments with that `opId` until the concatenated
data length equals the request. Use the `uint32` at payload offset 32
as the extra-data size for that fragment, and copy it to the byte
offset at payload offset 28 — fragments are not always delivered in
order. Do not treat extra data as part of AIO `size` (that field stays
44).

129-sector example (one client request, two server fragments):

```
C: type=7 opId=18 size=44  offset=0 length=66048
S: type=7 opId=18 size=44  dest=0     chunk=65536  + 65536 data
S: type=7 opId=18 size=44  dest=65536 chunk=512    + 512 data
```

`dest` in that dump is payload offset 28 (`ReadFragment.dest`): 0 and
65536 are positions in this 66048-byte read, not sector numbers.

## Lab check

Integration tests create an empty 10 GiB thin disk, write a repeating
pattern at each captured range (including 129 sectors), and read it
back. An unwritten region is zeros.

Writes use the same 44-byte IO payload with opcode `2`; see
`docs/nfc_write.md`.

## OpenVixDiskLib

`NfcDisk.read(start_sector, num_sectors)` in
`openvixdisklib/nfc_open.py`. Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/test_nfc_read_write.py
```

The integration test writes and then reads the captured VDDK ranges
(including a 129-sector transfer that must assemble two read
fragments).

## Skip decompression (OpenVixDiskLib extension)

`VixDiskLib_Read` always fills `buf` with uncompressed sector bytes.
OpenVixDiskLib can skip decoding (zlib, FastLZ, or SkipZ, whichever the
disk was opened with) so a backup application can forward the
compressed data as-is, avoiding unnecessary re-compression.

`NfcDisk.readinto(..., skip_decompression=True)` and
`VixDiskLibHandle.read(..., skip_decompression=True)` still send one
IO request and wait until uncompressed `filled == length`. They do
**not** decompress. Extras are packed densely from offset 0 of `buf`.
`ReadResult.fragments` describes each extra, tagged with its own
`compression_type` — a single read's fragments are not all guaranteed
to share one type, since any fragment that did not shrink still comes
back raw (type `0`) regardless of the open's compression flag.
Concatenating extras is not a valid compressed stream of any of the
three algorithms; the caller must use the table to split them.

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dest`                 | Byte offset **in this uncompressed read** (NFC payload 28). Not a disk LBA or VMDK file offset.  |
| `uncompressed_length`  | Uncompressed fragment size (NFC payload 32).                                                     |
| `compression_type`     | `NFC_COMPRESSION_NONE` (0), `_ZLIB` (1), `_FASTLZ` (2), or `_SKIPZ` (3), per fragment.           |
| `offset`               | Start of this extra in packed `buf` (receive order, densely from 0).                             |
| `length`               | Extra size on the wire.                                                                          |

Disk byte address of a fragment is `start_sector * 512 + dest`. A
129-sector `read` from sector 0 or from sector 1000 still reports
`dest=0` and `dest=65536` when extras are 64 KiB.

`buf` is sized for the uncompressed request, so it is always large
enough. Default `read` still decompresses; `fragments` is empty and
`compressed_length` is still the extra bytes on the wire.
`skip_decompression` with a plain (no compression) open only records
raw extras (`compressed_length == uncompressed_length`).

This is not `VixDiskLib_Read`. Do not add an open flag for it;
compression on the wire is already the open's compression flag.

A 32 MiB read at 64 KiB extras is 512 fragments in **one** result. A
2 MiB OPEN_SESSION extra (`aio_buffer_size=2097152`) is 16 fragments
for the same read. One dest PUT per extra is not viable.

```
uncompressed request (offsets in this read, not on disk)
|---------------- 64KiB --|-- 64KiB --|-- ... --|
     dest=0                    dest=65536
     extra (FastLZ or raw)     extra (FastLZ or raw)

buf when skip_decompression=True: extras packed densely from offset 0
```

## `VixDiskLib_QueryAllocatedBlocks` (AIO type 13)

Reverse-engineered by extending the SSL/write-hook capture (Step 13/14
technique, `docs/reverse_engineering_procedure.md`) to a ctypes call to
`VixDiskLib_QueryAllocatedBlocks` after `Open`, first with
`startSector=0` then — after the first capture's field guesses turned
out wrong — again with a non-zero `startSector` against a known
already-allocated region, to disambiguate fields that are 0 in the
degenerate zero-start case.

No SOAP or authd traffic; it is one more AIO message type in the
already-open NFC/AIO session (like `DDB_GET`).

Request (48 bytes)::

    uint64 handle          (from OPEN_FILE)
    uint64 reserved (0)
    uint64 chunk_size_bytes    (chunk_size_sectors * sector_size)
    uint64 start_offset_bytes  (start_sector * sector_size)
    uint64 chunk_count         (num_sectors // chunk_size_sectors)
    uint64 reserved (0)

**Field-order pitfall:** `start_offset_bytes` is at byte offset 24, not
8 — offset 8 is a reserved/always-zero field. A capture with
`startSector=0` can't tell these two apart (both read 0); only a
capture with a non-zero start distinguishes them.  A first
implementation attempt put `start_offset_bytes` at offset 8 and got
`chunk_count`-many all-zero bits back for every non-zero-start query,
even for byte ranges known (from a zero-start, full-range query) to be
allocated — the server was silently ignoring the offset the client
thought it was requesting and returning an artifact of a different
misread field.

Reply: a 48-byte body (offset 32 echoes `chunk_count`) followed by a
bitmap extra, one bit per chunk (LSB-first, `1` = chunk has allocated
data), **padded up to a 4-byte boundary** — `ceil(chunk_count / 8)`
alone is correct only when that value is already a multiple of 4
(true for the `chunk_count=16384` case tested first, which is why the
padding bug wasn't caught immediately; a `chunk_count=16` query
exposed it, since `ceil(16/8)=2` bytes under-reads the real 4-byte
reply and desyncs the connection — the *next* AIO reply's header then
reads as garbage).

Both `start_sector` and `num_sectors` must be exact multiples of
`chunk_size_sectors`; the server returns an `NFC_AIO_MSG_ERROR` (type
1) reply otherwise (hit by accident during validation with a
non-aligned `start_sector`).

`openvixdisklib.nfc_open.NfcDisk.query_allocated_blocks` implements
this and run-length-merges contiguous set bits into
`AllocatedBlock(offset, length)` tuples (sectors, matching VDDK's
`VixDiskLibBlock`), exposed as
`VixDiskLibHandle.query_allocated_blocks`. Validated against the live
ESXi lab: a full-disk query, a query of a known-allocated sub-range,
and an aligned empty range all match native VDDK's own
`VixDiskLib_QueryAllocatedBlocks` output on the same disk.

### Gotcha: query on the same still-open write handle can see stale data

Writing a sector and then immediately calling
`query_allocated_blocks` **on that same open handle, without closing
it first**, can report the just-written region as *not* allocated —
the allocation metadata this call reads apparently isn't guaranteed
current until the write handle is closed. Closing after the write and
reopening (or querying from a separate handle opened after the write
completed) reports it correctly. Confirmed on both native VDDK and
this implementation — same-session-no-close showed the write as
unallocated on both, a fresh handle after close showed it correctly
on both — so this is a real server/VMFS behavior, not a bug in either
client. Real backup tools reading allocation before a read pass
naturally do this anyway (open read-only after the writer's handle
already closed), so it's unlikely to bite in practice, but do not
call `query_allocated_blocks` right after a write on the same handle
and expect it to reflect that write.

## What is still VDDK-only

- `VixDiskLib_ReadAsync` (same IO messages, different client threading)
