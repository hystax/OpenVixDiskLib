# VDDK NFC disk read

This document records how VMware VDDK reads VMDK sectors over NBD/NFC
after the open in `docs/nfc_open.md`, and how OpenVixDiskLib
(`NfcDisk.read` in `openvixdisklib/nfc_open.py`) reproduces
`VixDiskLib_Read`. Capture method:
`docs/reverse_engineering_procedure.md`.

## Mapping from VDDK

`VixDiskLib_Read(handle, startSector, numSectors, buf)` becomes one
`NFC_AIO_MSG_IO` (type 7) on the NFC socket. Units on the wire are
**bytes**, not sectors:

```
offset = startSector * sectorSize
length = numSectors * sectorSize
```

`sectorSize` is 512 from the `OPEN_FILE` reply on this lab disk.

| VDDK call                         | Wire effect                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 1, buf)`   | IO offset 0, length 512, one 512-byte fragment   |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 1, 1, buf)`   | IO offset 512, length 512                        |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 128, buf)` | IO length 65536 (AIO buffer size), one fragment  |
| `VixDiskLib_Read(h, 0, 129, buf)` | One request of 66048; **two** reply fragments    |

VDDK does **not** split a `Read` larger than the AIO buffer into
multiple requests. The client sends one AIO message; the server
answers with one or more same-`opId` replies, each carrying at most
the OPEN_SESSION buffer size (VDDK default 65536).
`vixDiskLib.nfcAio.Session.BufSizeIn64KB=32` advertises 2 MiB; a
129-sector read then returns **one** 66048-byte extra, and a 2 MiB +
512 read returns 2097152 + 512. See `docs/nfc_open.md` (OPEN_SESSION).

Sparse regions are still transferred as zeros. A read of 8 sectors at
LBA 8 on this disk was 4096 zero bytes on the wire, not a skip.

## Request (44 bytes)

Little-endian, after the usual 16-byte AIO header
(`magic 0xA100DA7A`, type 7, size 44, monotonic `opId`):

| Offset | Type     | VDDK `Read(start, n)`                                      |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | `uint64` | File handle from `OPEN_FILE`                               |
| 8      | `uint64` | Direction in low 32 bits; FastLZ type `2` in high 32 bits  |
| 16     | `uint64` | Byte offset                                                |
| 24     | `uint64` | Byte length                                                |
| 32     | `uint32` | Byte length (same value)                                   |
| 36     | `uint32` | Byte length, or compressed extra size when type is FastLZ  |
| 40     | `uint32` | `0`                                                        |

An earlier guess that offset 36 was `NFC_DISK` (`2`) was wrong: a
1-sector VDDK read puts `512` in both `uint32` length fields. A Python
read that sent `(512, 2, 0)` still worked for one sector; OpenVixDiskLib
now matches VDDK.

`VIXDISKLIB_FLAG_OPEN_COMPRESSION_FASTLZ` does not change OPEN_FILE
flags. The IO opcode at offset 8 is a `uint64`: low 32 bits are still
`0`/`1` (write/read), high 32 bits are the NFC compression type
(`2` = FastLZ). OPEN still uses handshake `PlainText`.

| Open flag / wire                         | Request extra                         | Reply extra                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| No compression flag                      | Raw `length` bytes on write           | Raw fragment at offset 32                        |
| FASTLZ, data that shrinks                | FastLZ bytes; offset 36 = packed size | Opcode type `2`; extra is FastLZ of offset 32    |
| FASTLZ, incompressible                   | Raw bytes; opcode type `0`            | Opcode type `0`; extra is raw                    |

Reads with FASTLZ always *request* type `2`. The server may answer type
`2` or fall back to type `0`. Decompress into the uncompressed fragment
length at offset 32 and copy to the dest at offset 28.

64 KiB chunks use FastLZ level 2 (first byte has bit 5 set). Smaller
chunks use level 1. VDDK’s URL form is `FASTLZ-vpxa-nfc://…`; authd
`PROXY` is unchanged.

## Reply

Each fragment is: 16-byte AIO header (same `type` and `opId`) + 44-byte
payload + `chunkLength` data bytes.

Reply payload (handle is zeroed; lengths describe this fragment):

| Offset | Type     | Meaning                                                              |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | `uint64` | `0`                                                                  |
| 8      | `uint64` | `1` (read)                                                           |
| 16     | `uint64` | Byte offset of the **request** on disk                               |
| 24     | `uint32` | Total request length                                                 |
| 28     | `uint32` | Fragment byte offset **in this request** (`0`, `65536`, …), not disk |
| 32     | `uint32` | This fragment’s uncompressed byte length                             |
| 36     | `uint32` | Same as offset 32, or compressed extra size when type is FastLZ      |
| 40     | `uint32` | `0`                                                                  |

When there is a single fragment, offsets 24–31 look like a `uint64`
length (the fragment offset is 0). The 129-sector capture shows why
they are two `uint32`s: fragment 0 has `(66048, 0)` then chunk 65536;
fragment 1 has `(66048, 65536)` then chunk 512. `0x00010000` at offset
28 is the byte offset, not a 0-based index. Disk byte address of a
fragment is request offset (payload 16) plus payload 28.

Read loop: receive fragments with that `opId` until the concatenated
data length equals the request. Use the `uint32` at payload offset 32
as the extra-data size for that fragment, and copy it to the byte
offset at payload offset 28 — fragments are not always delivered in
order. Do not treat extra data as part of AIO `size` (that field stays
44).

129-sector example (one client request, two server fragments):

```
C: type=7 opId=18 size=44  offset=0 length=66048
S: type=7 opId=18 size=44  dest=0     chunk=65536  + 65536 data
S: type=7 opId=18 size=44  dest=65536 chunk=512    + 512 data
```

`dest` in that dump is payload offset 28 (`ReadFragment.dest`): 0 and
65536 are positions in this 66048-byte read, not sector numbers.

## Lab check

Integration tests create an empty 10 GiB thin disk, write a repeating
pattern at each captured range (including 129 sectors), and read it
back. An unwritten region is zeros.

Writes use the same 44-byte IO payload with opcode `2`; see
`docs/nfc_write.md`.

## OpenVixDiskLib

`NfcDisk.read(start_sector, num_sectors)` in
`openvixdisklib/nfc_open.py`. Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/test_nfc_read_write.py
```

The integration test writes and then reads the captured VDDK ranges
(including a 129-sector transfer that must assemble two read
fragments).

## Skip decompression (OpenVixDiskLib extension)

`VixDiskLib_Read` always fills `buf` with uncompressed sector bytes.
OpenVixDiskLib can skip FastLZ decode so a backup application can
forward the compressed data as-is, avoiding unnecessary re-compression.

`NfcDisk.readinto(..., skip_decompression=True)` and
`VixDiskLibHandle.read(..., skip_decompression=True)` still send one
IO request and wait until uncompressed `filled == length`. They do
**not** decompress. Extras are packed densely from offset 0 of `buf`.
`ReadResult.fragments` describes each extra. Type `2` extras are
FastLZ; type `0` fallbacks are raw. Concatenating extras is not a
valid FastLZ stream; the caller must use the table to split them.

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dest`                 | Byte offset **in this uncompressed read** (NFC payload 28). Not a disk LBA or VMDK file offset.  |
| `uncompressed_length`  | Uncompressed fragment size (NFC payload 32).                                                     |
| `compression_type`     | `NFC_COMPRESSION_NONE` (0) or `NFC_COMPRESSION_FASTLZ` (2).                                      |
| `offset`               | Start of this extra in packed `buf` (receive order, densely from 0).                             |
| `length`               | Extra size on the wire.                                                                          |

Disk byte address of a fragment is `start_sector * 512 + dest`. A
129-sector `read` from sector 0 or from sector 1000 still reports
`dest=0` and `dest=65536` when extras are 64 KiB.

`buf` is sized for the uncompressed request, so it is always large
enough. Default `read` still decompresses; `fragments` is empty and
`compressed_length` is still the extra bytes on the wire.
`skip_decompression` with a plain (no FASTLZ) open only records raw
extras (`compressed_length == uncompressed_length`).

This is not `VixDiskLib_Read`. Do not add an open flag for it;
compression on the wire is already the FASTLZ open flag.

A 32 MiB read at 64 KiB extras is 512 fragments in **one** result. A
2 MiB OPEN_SESSION extra (`aio_buffer_size=2097152`) is 16 fragments
for the same read. One dest PUT per extra is not viable.

```
uncompressed request (offsets in this read, not on disk)
|---------------- 64KiB --|-- 64KiB --|-- ... --|
     dest=0                    dest=65536
     extra (FastLZ or raw)     extra (FastLZ or raw)

buf when skip_decompression=True: extras packed densely from offset 0
```

## What is still VDDK-only

- zlib and skipz NBD compression flags
- `VixDiskLib_ReadAsync` (same IO messages, different client threading)
- `VixDiskLib_QueryAllocatedBlocks` / allocation bitmaps
